# Team Azul SideHustle react capstone project 1

In this project we recreated google home page (https://www.google.com/) and replaced google's logo with sidehustle's. Whenever a user types in the search field the logo is updated and the text he is writing is displayed and when the field is empty, the logo is displayed again.
